# Text Flappy Bird – Monte Carlo and Sarsa(λ) Agents

This project was completed as part of the 3MD3220 Reinforcement Learning course at CentraleSupélec.

## Overview

The goal of this assignment was to implement and compare two reinforcement learning algorithms—Monte Carlo and Sarsa(λ)—on the Text Flappy Bird environment. Two versions of the environment were explored:

- **State-based** (numerical observations: x- and y-distance to the pipe gap)
- **Screen-based** (pixel grid of the environment)

Agents were evaluated based on learning efficiency, performance stability, and generalization to unseen environment configurations.

## Contents

- `distancebased_flappy.py`: Training and evaluation code for the state-based environment.
- `screenbased_flappy.py`: Training and evaluation code for the screen-based environment.
- `README.md`: Project summary and structure.
